        <main>
            I'm taking this course for the following reasons:
            <ol>
                <li>
                    I'm interested in web development.
                </li>
                <li>
                    I hope to learn a bunch of weird quirks I otherwise wouldn't pick up on my own.
                </li>
                <li>
                    I've had this professor before and I'm a fan of his.
                </li>
            </ol>
