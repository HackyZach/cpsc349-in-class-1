                    This is my 2nd favorite hobby...
                    <br>
                    My family had to sell my favorite guitar (shown in picture) the year I graduated from highschool. It was my brother's birthday present, but he didn't play much.
                    Now, I own a red Fender Squire, but I haven't found much time to get better lately.
