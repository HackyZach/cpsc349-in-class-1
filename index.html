            <ul>
                I'm a programmer interested in cloud computing, web development, and smart speakers. 
            </ul>
            <ul>
                I got into programming when I was majoring in chemical engineering. I had to take Java and created some fun projects that got me hooked ever since.
            </ul>
            <ul>
                I've been in school forever and can't wait to graduate!!!
            </ul>
            <ul>
                When I get settled in to my career, I hope to travel, learn french, make a hit song, and create awesome projects.
